## 2026-04-24 — Agent infrastructure setup

- Created `CLAUDE.md`: comprehensive project orientation for AI agents (architecture, tech stack, key commands, data flow, API surface, failure modes). Eliminates need for codebase discovery on session start.
- Created `Agents.md`: agent behavioral rules, mandatory pre-commit checklist, development workflows per service type, code style conventions, pitfall list.
- Created `TASK_LOG.md`: this file — running log of agent work.
- Created `.claude/commands/typecheck.md`: `/typecheck` skill to run TypeScript type check on frontend.
- Created `.claude/commands/pre-commit-check.md`: `/pre-commit-check` skill to run all validation checks before committing (TS types, Docker config, Python syntax).
- Created `.claude/commands/docker-validate.md`: `/docker-validate` skill to validate Docker Compose YAML.
- Created `.claude/commands/update-task-log.md`: `/update-task-log` skill to append entries to this file.
- **Motivation**: Coding agents were not running type/lint checks before committing, causing Docker frontend builds to fail. Documentation was missing so agents re-ran codebase discovery on every session start.
